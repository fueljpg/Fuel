        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Clarity beats noise. Consistency beats hacks. Fuel removes friction so you can focus on the reps, meals, and sleep that actually move the needle.</p>
        <p>We design in monochrome to reduce distraction and increase contrast. We unify data so the app can think across Nutrition, Training, and Sleep—not in silos.</p>
        <p>Defaults matter. Fuel chooses sensible ones and adapts them based on your recovery and adherence.</p>
